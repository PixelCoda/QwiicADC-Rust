# Qwiic ADS1015 I2C library for Rust (WIP)

## Description

This library aims at controlling Qwiic ADC devices using I2C from Linux. Its primary target is ARM devices such as RaspberryPi or FriendlyARM's NanoPi Neo. It should nonetheless work on other Linux distributions with access to an I2C bus.

## How to use library

Add the following line to your cargo.toml:
```
qwiic-adc-rs = "0.1.0"
```

Or for the most recent commit on the master branch use:
```
qwiic-adc-rs = { git = "https://github.com/PixelCoda/QwiicADC-Rust.git", version = "*" }
```
